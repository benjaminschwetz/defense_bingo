# defense_bingo

Trick your friends into joining your talk and paying attention!

## What is this?

Defense Bingo is a simple web app packaged with Docker. All you need to supply is a list of words relevant to your presentation. People will be able to play bingo over your talk. 

## How to use it?

### Fork/Clone

### Add your words

Edit the `top_terms` file and fill it with the words you want to draw from. Needs to be at least 25 to not break the code. I found that 90 (same amount as numbers in normal bingo) works well. One line should be one word.

#### Poor man's version

simply edit the file with a text editor and add your favourite words manually.

#### Fancy version

run the following R code. 

```
code coming
```

### Host somewhere

### Share 

### Activate
